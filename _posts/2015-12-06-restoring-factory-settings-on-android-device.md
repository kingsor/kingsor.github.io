I was looking for restoring my old Samsung Galaxy S2 and I found a solution at the following link: [Restoring factory settings on the Samsung Galaxy S II](http://support.vodafone.com.au/articles/FAQ/How-to-restore-factory-settings-on-the-Samsung-Galaxy-S-II)

Everything started from here:

> With the phone still off, hold down the Power, Volume Up and Menu buttons at the same time for about 10 seconds. Release them when you see the green android logo. Thisâ€™ll get you into the unlock/reset menu.
