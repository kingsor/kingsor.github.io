I have a saying that I employ as a powerful metaphor at every startup with whom I work — “beware of shiny new objects.”

> All of this whiplash is destroying your business. All of these features, products, business models in their own right are valuable. Slowly. Sequentially. Thoughtfully. Methodically. Tested. In due course.

> I strongly believe that your success will be more defined by what you choose not to do than by what you choose to do.
> 
> Of course what you choose to do has be be meaningful, timely, valuable, prescient and high quality. Else you suck regardless.
> 
> the entire model of a startup is prioritizing resource constraints. So what you choose to do, do well and go deep. Or you risk having a product & business that is a mile wide and an inch deep. Great at nothing.
> 
> Everything you say “yes” to is incrementally one more thing to support and you die a death by a thousand cuts. I’ve seen it a million times. It’s more common than rare.
> 
> Focus is hard — especially when you’re not seeing immediate results. But ask yourself the harder questions of “why” and test remedies rather than just quickly trying the latest thing you’ve heard about.
> So when you’re in your resource allocation meeting, think about what things you can say “great idea, let’s add it to the long-term suggestion list” as opposed to actioning it.
