I was curious about static site generators. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is the most famous. But I started my search through [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/) filtering for C# language.

So I found [Pretzel](https://github.com/Code52/pretzel), written with C#. Pretzel follows the same conventions as Jekyll and should be compatible with basic Jekyll websites. So it's usefull to test locally my site and to learn going around its code.

Then it was the moment to choose the theme. I started searching on [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) and I tried different nice themes. But then I liked the theme of [Sa√∫l M.](http://saulmm.github.io/) site. And I used his site as a base for creating the theme for mine. It's the same except for the main color.

### Reference articles
* [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
* [Jekyll directory structure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) and [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)

### Note to Self
There is also [Static Site Generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) site. It provides the whole list in [JSON format](https://staticsitegenerators.net/list.json). So it may be usefull for testing with MongoDB or as an endpoint for an Android sample app.
