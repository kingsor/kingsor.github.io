I am a professional with a complete vision of the life cycle of a digital product. In addition to writing maintainable and scalable code, I focus on understanding business needs, designing robust architectures, and ensuring quality through iterative and optimized processes.

With solid technical skills (.NET Core, C#, Azure, Clean Code) and a broad vision of the creation process, I accompany companies from the idea to the creation of digital products.

I work as a full remote freelancer.
