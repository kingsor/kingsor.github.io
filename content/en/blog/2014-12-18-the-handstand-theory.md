[The handstand theory](https://medium.com/@p/the-handstand-theory-21a714e82dd6) by [Jesse Pollak](https://medium.com/@p)

> There are two ways to fall down in life: backwards and forwards.

> Falling back is always the easy route: when confronted with discomfort, I return to my familiar places, seek out the known quantities in my life and console myself that they are still there.

> Falling forward is terrifying: I reach out to grasp something and no matter the result, I tumble into the unfamiliar territory.

> As with handstands, I need to be comfortable tumbling into the unknown to find the balance that is always a little further than I’d expect.
