title: Why Developers Should Understand Design

source: [A Generalist Mentality](http://gluue.com/2010/02/a-generalist-mentality/)

> Mike Kus recently published [this article](http://carsonified.com/blog/uncategorized/5-good-reasons-why-designers-should-code/) about why designers should be able to code.

> We might suggest the opposite article be written as well: Why Developers Should Understand Design. Expanding your knowledge of the industry certainly can’t hurt the quality of the work you output… yet there’s a time and a place for specialists in the mix, too.

> From our small (yet global) studio perspective, it’s in our best interest to be generalists. Generalists are big picture people. They get the connections between things, and they understand the world view.

> Specialsts have their place, and in a big company they absolutely fit in. But in small business like ours, we thrive off diversely talented people who are good at understanding many things.
