My name is Edoardo and I'm a software developer living in Italy with over 17 years professional experience in designing and developing enterprise software solutions using mainly the .NET stack.  

I gained significant experience with the entire software lifecycle, starting from a simple proposal to a well-defined, coded, and tested solution.  

Highly productive with effective task management skills and a working knowledge of agile methodologies.  

I’m passionate about clean code and problem solving, constantly learning and exploring new technologies, and trends.  

This is the place where I collect stuff I’m interested in.
