I was reconsidering an old notebook I was using in 2012 when in a previous company and that they left to me when I changed job.
Is is already a good notebook with Windows 10 Pro onboard.
So I decided to reset it and install Visual Studio 2019 with Xamarin in order to try it for mobile development.

* [How to factory reset Windows 10](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-factory-reset-windows-10) (Aug 22, 2019)

After notebook reset to factory windows 10 pro, I started with windows updates and finally installed different tools and Visual Studio 2019 with Xamarin.

Then I started from here:
