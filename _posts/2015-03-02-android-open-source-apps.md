Inspiring article: [14 Great Android apps that are also open source](http://blog.interstellr.com/post/39321551640/14-great-android-apps-that-are-also-open-source)

### Wordpress for Android
[WordPress for Android](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android) - Source code of WordPress for Android,  that you can find it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android).

### Google I/O App
[Google I/O App](https://github.com/google/iosched)  
The source code for the 2014 version of the Google I/O app is now available. Since its first release on Google Play a few weeks before the conference, the I/O app was downloaded by hundreds of thousands of people, including on-site attendees, I/O Extended event participants and users tuning in from home. If one of the goals of the app is to be useful to conference attendees, the other primary goal is to serve as a practical example of best practices for Android app design and development.  

In addition to showing how to implement a wide variety of features that are useful for most Android apps, such as Fragments, Loaders, Services, Broadcast Receivers, alarms, notifications, SQLite databases, Content Providers, Action Bar and the Navigation Drawer, the I/O app source code also shows how to integrate with several Google products and services, from the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/) to [Google Cloud Messaging](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html). It uses the [material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) approach, the [Android L Preview APIs](http://developer.android.com/preview/index.html) and full [Android Wear](http://developer.android.com/wear/index.html) integration with a packaged wearable app for sending session feedback.

* [Philm is now open source](http://chris.banes.me/2014/06/18/philm-is-now-open-source/)  
  If you haven't seen Philm yet, it is a movie collection and information app that I created for Android. It uses the Trakt and TMDB APIs.  
This morning I pushed the source of Philm to [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisbanes/philm) under the Apache v2.0 licence.  
This does not mean that I have stopped development, it's just got to the point where I'm happy with it so can share the source.  
Philm has been a bit of an experiment as it uses a type of MVC-type architecture to split out UI, business and model code, something that has not really be explored (publicly) in Android development.
