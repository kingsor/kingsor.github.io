## Key Takeaways
* Find a problem in your life or by observing others and then pick one that is worth solving.
* Build Minimum Loveable Product (MLP) instead of Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
* Ship fast and often.
* Find organic ways of marketing from day one.

* Do not quit your job unless the side project is [ramen profitable](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html).
